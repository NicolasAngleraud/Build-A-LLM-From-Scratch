# Build-A-LLM-From-Scratch

Guided implementation and finetuning of a GPT-style Large Language Model from scratch using PyTorch following the book _Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)_ by bestselling author and AI researcher Sebastian Raschka, PhD.

This project is pedagogical and uses a very small dataset to avoid computational issues.
